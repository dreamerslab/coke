# COKE

“ COKE is a node.js MVC framework base on [Express](http://expressjs.com/). It does not add too many magic, instead it provides a clean and well structured project bootstrap. ”



## Features

  - MVC structure.
  - [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) as ODM (mongodb), supports validation.
  - Lightening fast template parsing with [thunder](https://github.com/dreamerslab/thunder). It renders over a million pages within a second. However it can be replaced with any express compatible ones if it does not fit your need.
  - RESTful routing, supports namespace and nested resource. Thanks to [RailwayJS](http://railwayjs.com/).
  - Assets management (something like assets pipeline in Rails). COKE uses a YAML file to manage all the assets. You can group them, specify which assets to be used in the action view. On production they will be combined and minified with a version number at the end.
  - Middleware and 3rd party lib support, which means all the [express](http://expressjs.com/) and [connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/) middlewares can be used directly.
  - Controller before and after filters.
  - Comprehensive logger for debugging.
  - Powerful generators for project prototyping.
  - Model command line console.
  - Cluster support.
  - Socket.io compatible.
